A simple Cocoa view framework for creating real-time and static plots and graphs.

Using SimplePlot is easy. Add the source to your project, treat any of the graphs or
plots as if they were native Cocoa controls. SimplePlots work like tableViews in that they
implement the DataSource pattern. Check the implementation for notes on what kind of
data the plot expects.

Any class that sounds familiar is probably a standalone plot. For example, if SPLineGraphView
sounds like a view for displaying a Line Graph, then you are absolutely correct.

Any class that sounds unfamiliar is probably a super class used to make SimplePlot extensible
and organized.  For example, SPCartesianPlotView is a super class that's used in any graphs
or plots that use XY axes.  These can be extended to create a plot view of your own choosing,
and do not include the ability to assign a DataSource.
